An analogous set of functions scans formatted text to yield values. Scan, Scanf and Scanln read from os.Stdin; Fscan, Fscanf and Fscanln read from a specified io.Reader; Sscan, Sscanf and Sscanln read from an argument string.

Scan, Fscan, Sscan treat newlines in the input as spaces.

Scanln, Fscanln and Sscanln stop scanning at a newline and require that the items be followed by a newline or EOF.

Scanf, Fscanf, and Sscanf parse the arguments according to a format string, analogous to that of Printf. In the text that follows, 'space' means any Unicode whitespace character except newline.

In the format string, a verb introduced by the % character consumes and parses input; these verbs are described in more detail below. A character other than %, space, or newline in the format consumes exactly that input character, which must be present. A newline with zero or more spaces before it in the format string consumes zero or more spaces in the input followed by a single newline or the end of the input. A space following a newline in the format string consumes zero or more spaces in the input. Otherwise, any run of one or more spaces in the format string consumes as many spaces as possible in the input. Unless the run of spaces in the format string appears adjacent to a newline, the run must consume at least one space from the input or find the end of the input.

The handling of spaces and newlines differs from that of C's scanf family: in C, newlines are treated as any other space, and it is never an error when a run of spaces in the format string finds no spaces to consume in the input.

The verbs behave analogously to those of Printf. For example, %x will scan an integer as a hexadecimal number, and %v will scan the default representation format for the value. The Printf verbs %p and %T and the flags # and + are not implemented. For floating-point and complex values, all valid formatting verbs (%b %e %E %f %F %g %G %x %X and %v) are equivalent and accept both decimal and hexadecimal notation (for example: "2.3e+7", "0x4.5p-8") and digit-separating underscores (for example: "3.14159_26535_89793").

Input processed by verbs is implicitly space-delimited: the implementation of every verb except %c starts by discarding leading spaces from the remaining input, and the %s verb (and %v reading into a string) stops consuming input at the first space or newline character.

The familiar base-setting prefixes 0b (binary), 0o and 0 (octal), and 0x (hexadecimal) are accepted when scanning integers without a format or with the %v verb, as are digit-separating underscores.

Width is interpreted in the input text but there is no syntax for scanning with a precision (no %5.2f, just %5f). If width is provided, it applies after leading spaces are trimmed and specifies the maximum number of runes to read to satisfy the verb. For example
